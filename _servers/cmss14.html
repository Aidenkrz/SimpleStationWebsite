                CMSS14, or Colonial Marines Space Station 14 (a real mouthful) originated when Pengu (charcoalgungan on Discord) was enamored with
                SS13's CMSS13 server, and wanted to replicate that experience in SS14.

                Parkstation was the first of the SimpleStation servers, and is managed by DEATHB4DEFEAT and
                Pspritechologsit. The primary focus of the server is longer lasting rounds with slower, calmer
                roleplay.
                <br>
                To this desire, Parkstation has signifigantly altered rules and Adminning systems to allow for a
                more relaxed and immersive experience. Admin intervention is high, with the aim of keeping things
                'on the right track' so to speak,
                although without negatively impacting the round. Players are expected to act as regular humans
                would, following rules of escalation and all else, unless explicitly granted additional access by a
                role.
                <br><br>
                Not only about Administration, though, Parkstation has many unique features. Among this list is a
                custom loadout system allowing players to join the round with items of their choosing for
                customization, fully fleshed 'under'
                slots for underwear, undershirts, and socks, the first ever 14 implimentation of the Station AI
                (though highly under development), and a substantial amount of tweaks all over to make it feel
                special.
                <br><br>
                Suffice to say it, if you're not looking for a more chill time with a little less going on,
                Parkstation likely isn't the server for you. If you want to relax, however, after a chaotic round,
                consider coming and touching grass!
